			A brief introduction about myself is that I was born in Malaysia before migrating over to Melbourne, Australia in 2012 and as of September 2024, I am in my fourth and final year of the 
			Bachelor of Applied Science (Surveying) (Honours) course. My surveying-related interests is working on large infrastructure projects like the Metro Tunnel project, Melbourne's Level Crossing Removal, the Suburban Rail Loop (SRL) and the North-East Link. 
			I also enjoy obtaining and analysing aerial-captured imagery and creating maps using spatial data. My current capstone surveying project involve the development of a new web-based agricultural land management mobile mapping application with GIS
			software and Trimble Business Centre to foster increased effectiveness, efficiency, and productivity in farming practices.
		</p>
		<p>
		My own personal hobbies include playing sports like badminton!

	<div class="paragraphs">
		Applied Geospatial Techniques (AGT) is a unique but very practical and interesting subject done in both the geospatial science and surveying degrees. The subject uses 
		knowledge from three different disciplines:
		<ul>
			<li>Surveying</li>
			<li>Geographical Information Systems (GIS)</li>
			<li>Cartography</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		I completed this course in the COVID impacted year of 2021, where the assignment was about the proposal of creating an amphitheatre at Deep Rock Oval located at Yarra Bend Park.
		The main deliverables of the subject consisted of producing:
		<ul>
			<li>Topographic survey map of Deep Rock Oval</li>
			<li>3D generated scene of the proposed amphitheatre</li>
			<li>Amphitheatre and Pathway plan of the proposed site</li>
			<li>Final map of the amphitheatre proposal</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The topographic survey map was created using surveying data obtained on the field using a total station at Deep Rock Oval, Yarra Bend Park.
			The topographic map was made using LISCAD.SEE and LISCAD.CAD. The 3D generated scene was created using the ArcGIS suite program ArcScene and the raw data was
			also modified in ArcGIS Pro. The proposed pathway was created using ArcGIS Pro by using the GIS program to generate the pathway based on slope angle and the amphitheatre
			based on z-values. The final map used Adobe Illustrator to create the map along with ArcMap for exporting the 2D amphitheathre image and ArcScene for 
			exporting the image of the 3D scene.

		Cartography consists of creating maps using spatial data obtained from sources such as publicly online government data and population numbers from the Australian
		Bureau of Statistics (ABS). While there were two tests and a first practical (not included as it was more of a report rather than a map), the significant
		practicals completed in Cartography 2 involved the production of three maps of the student's choice based on a specific topic:
		<ul> <!--Bullet points below-->
			<li>Practical 2: Map directed at a target audience of choice using provided data of Melbourne City</li>
			<li>Practical 3: Thematic mapping of a demographic's population using data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)</li>
			<li>Final Cartography Map: Free-choice on topic</li>
		</ul> <!--End of bullet points-->

		My time with SmartX as a part time Student Surveyor has equipped me with many geospatial and suveying skills and knowledge required in the industry. I have also been able to 
		apply my knowledge from being a current full-time student at RMIT University in the workforce in the industry.

		My time at AAM Group was part of an internship for the thirty day work experience subject. The work experience subject taught me a lot about what industry
		standard work is done within the geospatial industry. I chose to work at AAM Group as I read about it online on how it is a large company that does a lot of
		geospatial activity and to my personal knowledge, is one of the few companies that specialise solely on different forms of geospatial work as their primary
		source of business compared to other companies that have a spatial team but the company itself does not specialise in geospatial work. The work at AAM Group in 
		the Melbourne office was less about performing geospatial analysis on pre-existing data, but rather capturing and collecting their own spatial data which 
		the mapping team process and edit into a usable form for the client.
		<p>
		As part of the mapping team, the work I was exposed to was editing and processing aerial imagery-based data. The work consisted of editing out distortions and 
		errors in the aerial imagery, manipulating colour bands of the orthomosaics to brighten or darken the imagery to the client's needs and creating Digital 
		Terrain Models from provided LIDAR captured imagery from elevation models. My work at AAM Group used less ArcGIS products than I initially believed, using
		other programs such as Global Mapper and AAM-exclusive products due to their Melbourne work being focused on aerial imagery rather than spatial data analysis.
